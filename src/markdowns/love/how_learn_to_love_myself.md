# How do I learn to love myself

## Looking back, I have never really loved myself seriously

Yes, it does sound kind of bleak that one person never really loves himself for once for real. I have no idea why I treated myself like this in the past. But the general feels is that I simply can not imagine how does it feel to love myself. I've obviously crossed path with many great individuals that gave me advice for self-love, and I did consider them every single time. Still, I could not, for the life of me, learn what it is. I guess I have never really been loved, either by family or friends. That could be a strong reason for me to act like this, but alas, the history is long gone, and I'm more than ready to look ahead.

## So how do I learn to self love

A few coincidences made this happen. It did not happen spontaneously but rather a string of events pushed this to happen. First, I've realized whenever I went to any social event, there was people genuinely liked me. It happened more and more recently and I started to pick up on the frenquencies. Second, I started to quit dating since I felt like I was torturing myself when I couldn't even get comfortable with any stranger. Combining these 2 factors, I realized I was loved, but I was actively sabotaging myself with stressfully thinking about getting a successful date all day, every day.

I soon started to have some "me day"s, I went to kareoke (forgive if misspelled) alone, it was honestly freeing. I plan to do more "me day"s but for now I'm caught up with life for a bit, but I'll have plenty of alone time soon.

Can't wait to plan a bunch of things just for myself.

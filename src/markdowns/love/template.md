# I quit dating to find love

## Burned out from all the trying hard to find a partner

I feel like some healing is needed for myself, I recently started to learn to love and it naturally led to loving myself, and subsequently leading to quitting dating. I no longer do something futile to just to stay in the game or whatever, I simply know more than just trying for a worse outcome for my life. I'm intense at socializing, I get jealous literally from anything, I don't love myself, etc. All are the things I want to address before heading to dating. In another word, I'm not ready yet.

## Quitting dating before even being ready for it

You know what? I might be never ready for dating and I'm already quitting it. It's a lesser way to find love anyway, the best way to find love is to love. I'll just keep loving and the right girl will come and it'll all work out for me.

Have faith my friend.
